### Employee Management System

This project is a **Spring Boot-based Employee Management System** designed for role-based user access and management of employee data. The system provides different **dashboards** for Admins and Employees, with features for CRUD operations on employee records, project management, and finance tracking.

#### Key Features:
- **Role-Based Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login system using JWT, with Admin and Employee roles.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Allows Admins to create, edit, view, and delete employee records. Admins can also manage projects, and view financial details of employees.
- **Employee Dashboard**: Allows employees to view their personal, professional, and finance-related details. Employees can download payslips and view project history.
- **Project Management**: Admins can assign employees to projects and view project details.
- **Finance Module**: Tracks employee financial details like PAN card, Aadhar card, bank information, and CTC breakup.
- **Employee History**: Maintains a record of employee's previous employment history.
- **Validation**: Enforces data validation for fields like employment code, email, phone numbers, and address.

#### Tech Stack:
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot (MVC, JPA, Security)
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf or React (customizable for different dashboards)
- **Database**: MySQL (or any other RDBMS)
- **Security**: Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication and role-based access control
- **ORM**: Hibernate (JPA)
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI

#### Database Schema:
The database includes tables for `users`, `roles`, `employees`, `projects`, `finance`, `employment history`, `payslips`, and `addresses`, with clear relationships and constraints for efficient data management. Check the [ERD](./ERD.png) for detailed entity relationships.

#### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-management-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd employee-management-system
   ```
3. Configure your database settings in `application.properties` (MySQL is the default):
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ems_db
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
5. Access the app:
   - Visit `http://localhost:8080/login` to log in as Admin or Employee.

#### Screenshots:
- **Login Page**: A unified login page for Admins and Employees.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Allows managing employees, projects, and finances.
- **Employee Dashboard**: Displays employee details and project history.

#### Future Enhancements:
- Implement role-based access control in the frontend (React or Thymeleaf).
- Add support for additional employee-related documents (like certificates).
- Integrate a reporting module for admins (analytics, employee performance).
